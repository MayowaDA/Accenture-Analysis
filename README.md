I focused on analyzing user interaction data from a social media website. My role as a data analyst involved thorough data cleaning, detailed analysis, and the creation of a dynamic dashboard using Google Sheets. Here’s a summary of the work I performed:

Data Cleaning:
Standardized and formatted data to ensure uniformity and accuracy. Removed duplicate entries and filtered out anomalies to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

Data Analysis:
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in user interactions. Leveraged Excel’s advanced functions and pivot tables to break down engagement metrics such as likes, comments, shares, and active times. Performed segmentation to analyze interactions across different user demographics and activity periods.

Dashboard Creation:
Designed an interactive dashboard in Excel to visually represent the analyzed data. Included various charts and graphs, such as bar graphs, line charts, and heat maps, to effectively communicate insights. Implemented slicers and interactive filters to allow users to explore data by specific segments and criteria.

The resulting dashboard offers an intuitive interface for stakeholders to gain insights into user engagement, facilitating data-driven decision-making to improve user interaction strategies. Make this brief and better
